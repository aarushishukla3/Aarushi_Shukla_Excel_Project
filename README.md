AstroSage Call Center Optimization – Excel Data Analysis Project
This project analyzes two months of consultation data for AstroSage, a digital astrology service provider, aiming to improve operational efficiency after a ₹1 crore investment.

Using Microsoft Excel, I cleaned, structured, and analyzed raw call center data to extract key insights and identify optimization opportunities across different service types—Calls, Chats, Complementary, and Public Live Calls.

Tools & Techniques- 
Data Cleaning: TRIM, SUBSTITUTE, TEXT, IF, ISBLANK

Analysis: SUMIFS, COUNTIFS, AVERAGE, Pivot Tables

Visualization: Charts, Dashboards, Slicers, Conditional Formatting

Key Insights-
Call consultations bring 79% of revenue but have high no-answer and failure rates.

Chat and complementary services are underutilized—training and promotion needed.

Peak hours are 10 AM–6 PM, suggesting shift optimization.

Top astrologers deliver more consultations and higher satisfaction.

Recommendations-
Train agents on underperforming services like chat and live consults.

Promote alternative consultation types via app offers or campaigns.

Improve mobile app UX to boost usage.

Align staffing with high-traffic hours.

Learn from top-performing gurus to improve overall performance.

This project showcases my ability to apply Excel-based data analytics to real business problems—transforming raw operational data into actionable insights for strategic decisions.
